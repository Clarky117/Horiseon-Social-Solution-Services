# Horiseon Social Solution Services
In the week one coding bootcamp assignment we have been given an 'on-the-job ticket' where we need to modify the starter code provided by our client to meet their acceptance criteria.

<br><br>

## Expectations
In order to satisfy our client we need to 'Refactor' their source code including but not limited to;
* Adding semantic HTML elements to the source code
* Restructuring and tidying up the code, adding logical structure without changing the performance of the website
* Making icon and image elements more accessable to the broader community ie. screen readers narrating image files.
* Making sure heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Standing out from the rest of the pack with a clear and concise title element
