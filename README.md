# Horiseon Social Solution Services
In the week one coding bootcamp assignment we have been given an 'on-the-job ticket' where we need to modify the starter code provided by our client to meet their acceptance criteria.

<br><br>

## Expectations
In order to satisfy our client we need to 'Refactor' their source code including but not limited to;
* Adding semantic HTML elements to the source code
* Restructuring and tidying up the code, adding logical structure without changing the performance of the website
* Making icon and image elements more accessable to the broader community ie. screen readers narrating image files.
* Making sure heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Standing out from the rest of the pack with a clear and concise title element

<br><br>

## Site Presentation
Below is how the site has been presented to us;

<br><br>

## Steps Taken
1. Created a new repository on my GitHub account
2. Refactored clients source code to meet criteria without changing how the website looks or behave externally
3. Uploaded changes to the new repository using git commands such as 'git add', 'git commit', and 'git push'
4. Making sure the website has gone live by selecting that repository as the 'main' branch source and navigating to the correct url.
